Charging station management system

This project was created for the second and third phases of the Og√≥lnopolskie Zawody Techniczne "Primus Inter Pares" contest, where it won 1st place.

In the second phase, we had one month to develop an application that manages a charging system. In the third phase, we had 21 hours to build our own charging station. Please keep in mind that our code was written under time constraints, so some parts may not be implemented in the most optimal way.
